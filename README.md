This repository contains the Arduino code driving the **Universal Automation Box**, a modular home automation system. The code integrates various sensors (e.g., clap, motion, light) with relay modules to control electrical outlets, enabling automation of everyday appliances like lamps and kitchen tools.  

Features include:  
- Real-time sensor input processing  
- Relay control for connected devices  
- Customizable logic for automation rules  
- Energy-efficient and user-friendly design  

Designed for sustainability and modularity, this code is the core of a system that promotes eco-conscious automation.
